Do not use this program for negative purposes.

This is a small program written in C++.
The main page and the games are all in Chinese, but you can partly change them into English by changing the variable "language" in the class game::minecraft::[line 734].
If you find any bug or stupid code, please send an email to my account zidinghe@163.com , this is very important to me!
I will make an English version of it ASAP.

The starting page is a "sign in" interface. please input usename "abc" and password "123456" to go into the main program or view more "accounts" in the code.
Using other accounts may destroy the balance of the game. Please be rational!

Enjoy playing!
