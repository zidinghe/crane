A C++ Console 2D Minecraft program

Do not use this program for negative purposes.

This is a small program written in C++.
The main page and the games are all in Chinese, but you can partly change them into English by changing "language" in the class game::minecraft::languages (line 734) .
If you find any bugs, please send an email to my account zidinghe@163.com , this is very important to my program!

The starting page is a "sign in" interface. please input "abc" and "123456" to go into the main program or view more "accounts" in the code.
Using other accounts may destroy the balance of the game. Please be rational!

Enjoy playing!
